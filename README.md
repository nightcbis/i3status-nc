# i3status-nc
# My version of i3status, just an experiment right now.
# I will have support for: Hostname, Wifi-ssid and signal strength, Battery-level and animated icon when charging, screen brightness, volume and date.

Right now only getDate and getHostname work.
And they don't have any options.
I will probably never fix that....
